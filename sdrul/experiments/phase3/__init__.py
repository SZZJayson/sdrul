Phase 3: Full Framework Integration Experiments

This phase validates the complete SDFT-DIMIX framework combining:
- DCD (Degradation-Conditioned Diffusion) for generative replay
- TCSD (Trajectory-Conditioned Self-Distillation) for adaptation
- DSA-MoE (Degradation-Stage-Aware MoE) for knowledge organization
- EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation) for regularization

Key experiments:
